# Description
The AWS Audit Playbook is an open-source project designed to ELIMINATE screenshots from the AWS audit process. To accomplish this mission, we are building the following:
- Library of controls with detailed evidence collection & testing steps
- A [script](./gather_audit_evidence.py) to generate all necessary audit evidence.
- An open source [audit workpaper](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bGfbXUTSzVCSGCWn7UtG6QN4wWeEKdrubygcCuDDjbI/edit?usp=sharing)
- Example JSON files and detailed instructions for how to test each control

With your help, we hope that screenshots of AWS will be extinct by **12/31/2026**.
