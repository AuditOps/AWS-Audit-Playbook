# Description
The AWS Audit Playbook is an open-source project designed to ELIMINATE screenshots from the AWS audit process. To accomplish this mission, we are building the following:
- Library of controls with detailed evidence collection & testing steps
- An open source [audit workpaper](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bGfbXUTSzVCSGCWn7UtG6QN4wWeEKdrubygcCuDDjbI/edit?usp=sharing)
- Videos / auditor training to show why JSON files directly from AWS are significantly better than screenshots

With your help, we are aiming that 12/31/2026, auditors asking for a screenshot of AWS will be as obsolete as asking clients to fax over their audit evidence.
